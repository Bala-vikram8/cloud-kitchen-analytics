🍽️ Cloud Kitchen Analytics: Performance & Operations Dashboard
 
 Project Overview : Food delivery is booming—but cloud kitchens often struggle to optimize peak hours, streamline operations, and identify top-performing brands and zones. In this project, I built an end-to-end analytics solution using Google BigQuery, machine learning, and Tableau to turn raw order data into actionable business insights for cloud kitchens.

What I Did

I designed and executed a data engineering and analytics pipeline to solve these business questions:

        •	When are the busiest hours for food delivery?

        •	Which restaurants and zones drive the most orders?
	
        •	How can operations be optimized based on predicted demand patterns?

How I Did It

Technologies Used

	•	Google BigQuery (SQL, ML) – Data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling
 
	•	Tableau Public – Dashboard development and business storytelling

Key Steps

	•	Data Cleaning & Preparation: Used BigQuery SQL to clean and transform 21,000+ order records
 
	•	Feature Engineering: Extracted order hours, busy hours, day of week, restaurant, subzone, and order status
 
	•	Exploratory Analysis: Uncovered order patterns by hour, brand, and geography
 
	•	Machine Learning: Built a logistic regression model to predict busy hours directly in BigQuery ML
 
	•	Visualization: Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize trends, hotspots, and bottlenecks

What It Led To

		📈 Predicted Peak (Busy) Hours for kitchen operations
  
		🏆 Ranked Top Restaurants & Subzones by order volume
	
        📊 Visualized Order Trends by hour, brand, and area
		
        ⚡ Identified operational bottlenecks & opportunities for targeted improvements

💡 Recommendations

Based on the data, I recommend:

        •	Increase staffing and prep during 7–10 PM busy hours

        •	Double-down on top-performing brands and subzones for promotions
	
        •	Streamline operations for “delivered” and “cancelled” order patterns

What I Gained

	•	End-to-end project experience: data engineering, ML, and visualization
 
	•	Hands-on practice with BigQuery ML and Tableau dashboarding
 
	•	Real-world data storytelling for business decision makers
