**🍽️ Cloud Kitchen Analytics: Performance & Operations Dashboard**
 
 Project Overview : Food delivery is booming, but cloud kitchens face constant challenges in predicting peak hours, optimizing staffing, and identifying top-performing brands and locations. I built an end-to-end analytics solution using Google BigQuery (SQL & ML) and Tableau Public to turn real food order data into actionable business insights for cloud kitchen operators.

What I Did

	•	Designed and executed a data engineering and analytics pipeline to answer
 
	•	When are the busiest hours for food delivery?
 
	•	Which restaurants and subzones drive the most orders?
 
	•	Where do operational bottlenecks exist and how can they be addressed?

How I Did It

Technologies Used

	•	Google BigQuery (SQL, ML) – Data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling
 
	•	Tableau Public – Dashboard development and business storytelling

Key Steps

	•	Data cleaning & preparation of 21,000+ real cloud kitchen orders (SQL in BigQuery)
 
	•	Feature engineering (order hour, busy hour flag, day of week, restaurant/subzone)
 
	•	Exploratory analysis (order trends by hour, brand, area)
 
	•	Built and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict busy hours in BigQuery ML
 
	•	Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard for actionable insights

What It Led To

	🕒       Predicted Peak (Busy) Hours for better kitchen scheduling and staffing
 
	🏆 	Identified Top Restaurants & Subzones to target marketing and promos
 
	📉	Visualized Operational Trends by hour, restaurant, and location
 
	📊	Pinpointed Bottlenecks—such as high cancellation/return rates or uneven order volume

💡 Recommendations

Based on the data, I recommend:

        •	Increase staffing and prep during 7–10 PM busy hours

        •	Double-down on top-performing brands and subzones for promotions
	
        •	Streamline operations for “delivered” and “cancelled” order patterns

What I Gained

	•	End-to-end project experience: data engineering, ML, and visualization
 
	•	Hands-on practice with BigQuery ML and Tableau dashboarding
 
	•	Real-world data storytelling for business decision makers
